# Build Note #1

## What device/OS to use?
Next step would be making the idea into actual code. And there were many choices that I could take. To make the project as versatile as possible, I would like to demonstrate it as an mobile app so that many people can actually test it.
Android would be one of the best candidate because of it is available on many affordable devices including popular single board computers.

## Hybrid game engine
Even with Android OS, it is still a far way to go. I choose Cocos2d-x game engine as my helper because it provides many features to implement games and similar applications. By using Cocos-X, the final product would be available on Windows and iOS as well. Please note that it is also open-sourced, royalty-free engine.
