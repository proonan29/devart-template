# Build Note - 3

## Variation on Palette
I won't be the only person who fill bored to watch similar patterns over and over again. How about filling the canvas with different palettes? I made 4 different palettes and tested to see what would happen.
Each palette has 256 meaningful pixels used as height map.

## Palette 1 - Original scheme
Using this palette yielded results which make us imagine surface of Earth.

## Palette 2 - Red & Blue
Red dots & blue dots are creating the power balance between two sides.

## Palette 3 - Black & White
It looked like some fog or cloud to me. There could be many interpretation.

## Palette 4 - Lava filled mountains
Yellow and green dots tried to dominate each realm. But it won't last too long.

Generating different fascinating images could be done just by supplying more gradient images.
